# My First Jenkins Project

This repository marks my first experience using **Jenkins**, a popular automation tool widely used in software development to implement **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Delivery (CD)** practices.

## ðŸ›  What is Jenkins?

[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) is an open-source automation server written in Java. It is primarily used to automate tasks related to software development, such as:

- Building code
- Running tests
- Automatically deploying applications

Jenkins allows you to create custom *pipelines* that define each step of your build, test, and deployment process.

## ðŸš€ Purpose of this Repository

This project serves as my first hands-on exercise with Jenkins. The main goal is to:

- Install Jenkins in a local environment
- Set up a basic pipeline that:
  1. Pulls the code from this repository
  2. Executes a simple test script (e.g., a `hello world`)
  3. Marks the beginning of my journey learning CI/CD
